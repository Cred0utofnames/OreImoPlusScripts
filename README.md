# OreImoPlusScripts
This is a repository made to hold OreImo Plus' scripts.
The goal is to have the scripts in a format that translators can use. Ultimately, the goal is to have them all translated.
The "OG" folder holds the scripts in their original form, exactly as GARBRO extracted them.
The "needmanualextraction" folder holds scripts that were broken and thus need their text to be manually transcribed from the game.
The "clean" folder contains the non-broken scripts in a clean form.
If you wish to translate a script, grab one from the "clean" folder and when you're done, move it to the "partially-translated" or "translated" folder.
When translating spoken dialogue, please make sure to not surround the text with quotation marks. Also, do not translate the nametags or remove any lines that read: "AZU(number)" or "KIR(number)".
